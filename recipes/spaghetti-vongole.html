  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>8 cups water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 red Thai chile pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>2 pounds verace clams in shell, scrubbed</li>
    <li>¾ cup white wine</li>
    <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring water to a boil in a stockpot; add salt. Reduce heat to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add oil, followed by chile pepper and garlic. Cook and stir gently until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove garlic and chile pepper; discard. Add clams to the fragrant oil.</li>
    <li>Pour wine over the clams and cover immediately. Let simmer until clams have opened, about 7 minutes. Remove clams using a slotted spoon to a large bowl. Cover to avoid losing their steam. Discard any unopened clams.</li>
    <li>Pour four ladles of salted water into the skillet with the juice of the clams. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add spaghetti; move around with a pasta fork to keep from sticking together. Cook, adding a ladle or two of salted water as needed to keep spaghetti barely covered, until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Add clams and sprinkle in lemon zest. Give the skillet a hefty toss to gently mix the clams in the thickened sauce.
    </li>
    <li>Divide into four pasta bowls. Cover with parsley and serve immediately with empty plates on the side for the shells while eating.
    </li>
  </ol>
